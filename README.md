## Getting Started

These instructions will running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

To run, you will need an installed node, preferably 10 version. However, it is much more convenient to use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installation-and-update) or its analogues.
You will also need an postgres instance running locally either directly or in a docker-container, or, easiest of all, you can get a free instance on [elephantsql.com](https://www.elephantsql.com/) -- it will take no more than 5 minutes.

### Installing

When run locally make sure that you added postgres instance creds in `.env` file. To know which variables to use you have to look in `./config/default.js`. In simplest case your `.env` should be look like:

```dotenv
PG_URL=postgres://ljfsdl:llfdoDS40_KUppp@dkwjjds.db.elephantsql.com:5432/ljfsdl
```

So now you ready to **start** from:

```
npm i
```

and then

```
npm start
```

to build and start server in prod mode or

```
npm run start:dev
```

to run server in dev mode with rebuilding on changes.

At any time you can start filling db with fixtures, this script works independently from server:

```bash
npm run fixtures
```

**Be attentive:** it drops db and schemes.

It will creates examples of all entities and users. **All** users come with password `1234`. For convenience there are also some users **with emails which match their roles:** admin@mail.com, observer@mail.com, ringer@mail.com, scientist@mail.com, moderator@mail.com.

### API Structure

Main app routes are

- `users/`
- `auth/`
- `observations/` and
- `rings/`

Although it would be best to **start the diggin by going to the OpenAPI documentation located at `swagger/`**

## Running the tests & linting

Project is committing to ESLint coding styles with formatting via Prettier.

To lint `.ts` files run:

```
npm run lint
```

or

```
npm run lint:fix
```

if you want to simultaneously fix them.

Also project has tests which can be run with command

```
npm test
```

With adding modifications `:coverage` or `:watch` should be run corresponding commands. Don't forget about `run` after `npm`.

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system

## Contributing

By default any time you commit will be started linting which includes `eslint` & `prettier`.

There also exists template for Pull Requests. Please fill it as much as possible.
